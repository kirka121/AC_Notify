notes:
TERMS: 	Algonquin version: the version of classroom portal written to date. works with algonquin network only
		Notify / Generic version: the new version which is to be coded. works with anything, anywhere. works for multiple purposes, is 99% web based.

Lina, Patti [head], Allison; in charge of the marketing.

key necessities:
- contract of scope
- take a look at patientway, see if can incorporate into Algonquin version of classroom portal for routing
- make very generic version, for hi-rise building or commercial set ups
- monitor the usage of the devices to gather information about best use cases 		(LOG ALL THE THINGS!!!) 

extra:
- front page needs to be either a time table or a generic sign / html
- we have 4 devices in the T building.
- schedule the meetings using the server for rooms; t125, t108, t307 				(algonquin version)
- public / local access switch														(generic version)
- system installation module														(generic version)
- research the implications of leaving the charger in the tablet
- research patientway vs way finder. which one is easier to put in for routing and why
- touch capability still present, we need to disable ability to exit application	(both)
- sit down with hardware guy to see how to mount the actual tablet.
- front page swipes different ads as it goes.										(generic, optional)
- what are the potential markets for this application? generate a report.
- support for very large screens
- zoom in capabilities
- path finding on generic is important, but only for the setup. not the pathfinder build by college. (e.g dont stress over pathfinder for generic.)
- hospital setting?
- rideau center replace the billboards for routefinding with massive touch screens, for interactive UI
- limit the scope!
- we need GIT
